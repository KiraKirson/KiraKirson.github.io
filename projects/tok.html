            My work on this project was split down the middle between art and programming. A lot of the monster designs and animations, as well as the main character and his animations, were done by me. On the programming side of it, I was  tasked with getting the enemy AI working, as well as doing all the attacks and the pickup.  This was my first time working in Unity, as well as using C#.  This was also my first time  with pixel art and animation. I found it quite enjoyable!
