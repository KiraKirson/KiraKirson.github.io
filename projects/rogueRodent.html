        <h3>Rogue Rodent</h3>
        <p>Rogue Rodent is a  project made in Unreal with my group DroppedPocket. In this game you play as the mouse, Mousse,  who has been disowned by the Rat King who has attempted to launch an attack on the humans  by infecting them with the plague.</p>

        <h4>My Experience</h4>
        <p>
        Rogue Rodent was a very large and involved project done as my final project at SCAD. There were  eight of us in the first half, with me as the only programmer, then we invited on another programmer in the second half. We used perforce to work on it simultaneously, which was really  helpful for merging and updating our project with everyone's work.
        </p>
        <p>
        My work for the project was most of the functionality, especially in the first half. I got experience scripting our unique mechanic of being able to slow time and select nails, before resuming time and having Mousse jump from nail to nail in the order they were selected. Basic movement, health, and functioning UI and menus were part of my contribution, as well as a climbing mechanic that would grab onto ledges if you jumped into them.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The biggest issues that came up for me during the first half were definitely a lot of camera issues. Jumping from nail to nail would jerk the camera wildly, and often would get the character stuck in the walls or fling them off the nail when time resumed. I had a ton of trouble finding any help online, because it didn't seem like anyone else had this problem. I did my best to make it smoother, and it's much less noticeable now than when we started, but I feel like I could have done better in that regard. 
        </p>
        <p>
        During the second half we got a second programmer on board, and I was so excited to be working with someone. He and I split the workload, and I did a lot with adding animation, learning how to blend animation for dynamic-looking movement, and an absolute ton  of bug-fixing. A lot of issues started popping up in regards to overlaps and collision, and it took us a lot of trial and error to make it work consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the end, I'm proud of our project and how much I got to learn,  from working extensively with Unreal to using Perforce to working in a bigger team than I've ever had before.  I really loved my team members and I'm happy to have learned extensively the differences between Unreal and Unity.
