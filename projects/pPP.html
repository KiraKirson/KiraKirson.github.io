        <h3>Pleasant Peasant Planner</h3>
        <p>Pleasant Peasant Planner is a small, playable demo that I created entirely by myself. Made in Unity, in this game you take the role of a new leader forming their kingdom. You must explore your surroundings for materials, give your citizens tasks, and make decisions that will impact your expansion.</p>

            As it stands right now, PPP is a cute little demo that I'm  proud of for what it is, but there was definitely a lot more I had planned on putting in. Like always, the project needed to be scoped down, but I did account for that, and tried to rank the tasks I needed to complete in a way that would give me a functional product almost every step of the way. Almost. I'm still learning.

            <ul>
                
                <li>Move the camera</li>
                <li>Click on buildings to bring up their floating menu</li>
                <li>Assign and remove a person from their task</li>
                <li>Create new people</li>
                <li>Build buildings once their materials have been gathered</li>
                <li>Follow a tutorial!</li>
            </ul>
