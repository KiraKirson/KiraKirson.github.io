        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a programmer  and video game designer who graduated with a Bachelors Degree from the Savannah College of Art and Design in 2020. Besides playing video games, I enjoy building computers, keeping fish, playing piano, discussing TV shows, and tabletop role-playing.
        </p>
        <p>     
            As far as games are concerned, I have a lot of experience with working in a team environment from designing and working on games for class. I also enjoy being the GM for lots of different groups, and I delight in the combat balancing, puzzle creation and world-building aspects of that the most.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my favorite games include Kirby Air Ride, Inside, Portal 2, Undertale and Noita. I tend to enjoy games with amazing sound design, puzzle elements and unique gameplay. Kirby games have a special place in my heart for their easygoing, positive and friendly attitudes more than anything.
